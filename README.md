### **Project Setup**

To run this notebook, you'll need to set up a Python virtual environment and install the required packages.

**Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment**

First, create a new virtual environment using Python 3.12. This keeps your project dependencies isolated.

```bash
python3.12 -m venv venv
```

**Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment**

Activate the new environment using the appropriate command for your operating system.

  * **macOS / Linux**
    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
  * **Windows**
    ```bash
    venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

**Step 3: Install Dependencies**

With the virtual environment active, install all the necessary packages from the `requirements.txt` file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Step 4: Run the Jupyter Notebook**

Finally, start the research.ipynb to run the project.
